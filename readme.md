Project: Sleep Quality Prediction Analysis
This is a complete data science workflow focused on predictive modeling, built to validate core machine learning and data engineering proficiency.

Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between various lifestyle and health metrics and an individual's sleep quality (a score on a 1â€“10 scale). The primary objective was to develop a robust machine learning pipeline capable of accurately predicting this score, while providing clear insights into the factors that influence sleep health.

Methodology and Model Comparison

Component	Technology / Concept	Significance

Data Preprocessing	Scikit-learn Pipeline, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder	Established a robust, clean pipeline to handle both numerical and categorical features, ensuring data normalization and preventing data leakage across training and test sets.
Baseline Model	Linear Regression	Established an interpretable baseline (R^2=0.95) to quantify the minimal compute necessary for highly accurate prediction.
Optimization	Random Forest Regressor + GridSearchCV	Systematically tuned hyperparameters to minimize error, achieving superior test performance (R^2=0.98), demonstrating expertise in model refinement and optimization.
Model Artifact	Joblib Serialization	The best-performing model was saved to disk as a final artifact, showcasing model preparation for deployment.

The comparison between the baseline Linear Regression model and the optimized Random Forest Regressor revealed significant insights into the predictive power of the features. The optimized model achieved superior performance, confirming the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning. The project also included a feature importance analysis to highlight which specific metrics were most influential in predicting sleep quality.
The final result is a production-ready model that is both highly accurate and interpretable, providing a strong foundation for future research or application.
